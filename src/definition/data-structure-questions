Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:
why do we need data structure?
        A data structure is a specialized format for organising and storing data. General data structure types include the array,
       the file, the record, the table, the tree, and so on. Any data structure is designed to organize data to suit a specific purpose
       so that it can be accessed and worked with in appropriate ways.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
 Traversing, Searching, Inserting, Deleting, Sorting and Merging.
List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
Data Structures are mostly used in Database Management System, Compiler Design, Operating System, Statistical analysis package,
     Numerical Analysis, Graphics, Artificial Intelligence and Simulation.
what is an Array?
 Array is used to store block memory. Also we can say array is used to store a collection of data
what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
The main difference with Array and ArrayList is, in Array the array size is static in nature. That means its length is fixed.
     we canâ€™t change its size once it is created. On the other hand ArrayList is dynamic in nature. ArrayList is also called as dynamic array or re-sizable array.

what is LinkedList?
LinkedList is a linear data structure where each element is a separate object.
How is an Array different from Linked List?
 An array, each element is independent, no connection with previous element or with its location. In Linked list, location or address
what is queue?
what is stack?
what is FIFO and LIFO?
what is the order of complexity?
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
what is tree in data structure?
what is graph in data structure?
what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
How HashMap works in java?
What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
What is difference between an array and a linked list?
What is DFS and BFS?
What is Recursion?
What are linear and non linear data Structures?
What is Big-(O)-notation?
Outline different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
